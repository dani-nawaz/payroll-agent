# 🔄 Background Monitor Agent - Separate Continuous Process

## 🎯 **Perfect Solution: Separate Background Agent**

You're absolutely right! The system now has a **separate Background Monitor Agent** that runs continuously in its own process, and you can check its logs whenever you want without interrupting the monitoring.

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **1. Separate Background Process**
```bash
# Option 1: Run as standalone process
python run_background_monitor.py

# Option 2: Start from main system
python run.py
> start background monitor
```

### **2. Independent Operation**
```
Background Monitor Agent ←→ Main System
         ↓                        ↓
   Continuous monitoring    Your work continues
   Logs everything         Check logs anytime
   Processes emails        No interruption
   AI analysis            Full control
```

### **3. Log Access Anytime**
```bash
# Check logs without interrupting monitoring
> get monitor logs

# Check status
> get monitor status

# Filter logs
> get monitor logs limit=20 level=INFO
```

## 🛠️ **Available Commands**

### **Start Background Monitoring**
```bash
"start background monitor"    # Start continuous monitoring
```

### **Check Logs**
```bash
"get monitor logs"                    # Get recent logs
"get monitor logs limit=50"          # Get last 50 logs
"get monitor logs level=INFO"        # Filter by level
"get monitor logs limit=10 level=ERROR"  # Filter and limit
```

### **Check Status**
```bash
"get monitor status"    # Check monitoring status
```

### **Stop Monitoring**
```bash
"stop background monitor"    # Stop background monitoring
```

## 📊 **Log Levels**

The background monitor maintains detailed logs with different levels:

- **ℹ️ INFO**: General information, startup, status updates
- **⚠️ WARNING**: Issues that need attention
- **❌ ERROR**: Errors that occurred
- **🔔 NOTIFICATION**: New email replies and AI analysis results

## 📋 **Log Example**

```
📋 Background Monitor Logs (showing last 5 entries):

ℹ️ [2025-01-27 10:30:15] INFO: Starting Background Monitor Agent
ℹ️ [2025-01-27 10:30:15] INFO: Log file: /path/to/logs/background_monitor.log
🔔 [2025-01-27 10:31:20] NOTIFICATION: New email reply from John Smith
   📝 Details: {
     "from_email": "john.smith@example.com",
     "from_name": "John Smith",
     "subject": "Re: Timesheet Issue - 2025-08-08",
     "content_preview": "I was sick on that day, couldn't come to work...",
     "reason_valid": true,
     "reason_type": "sick",
     "timesheet_date": "2025-08-08"
   }

ℹ️ [2025-01-27 10:31:21] INFO: Valid reason detected: sick
ℹ️ [2025-01-27 10:32:00] INFO: Email monitoring check completed
```

## 🎮 **Usage Examples**

### **Scenario 1: Start and Work**
```bash
python run.py
> start background monitor
✅ Background monitor started successfully. Check logs with 'get monitor logs'

> analyze timesheets
[Your timesheet analysis continues while monitoring runs in background]

> get monitor logs
[Check logs without interrupting monitoring]

> send email to all employees with pending
[Email sending continues while monitoring runs in background]
```

### **Scenario 2: Check Status and Logs**
```bash
> get monitor status
📊 Background Monitor Status:
• Active: ✅ Yes
• Total Logs: 45
• Log File: /path/to/logs/background_monitor.log
• Last Log: 2025-01-27 10:32:00 - Email monitoring check completed

📧 Email Monitoring:
• Active: ✅ Yes
• Last Check: 2025-01-27T10:32:00
• Processed Messages: 3
• Check Interval: 60 seconds

> get monitor logs limit=10
[Shows last 10 log entries with timestamps and details]
```

### **Scenario 3: Filter Logs**
```bash
> get monitor logs level=NOTIFICATION
[Shows only notification logs - new email replies]

> get monitor logs level=ERROR
[Shows only error logs]

> get monitor logs limit=5 level=INFO
[Shows last 5 info logs]
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Separate Process Architecture**
```python
class BackgroundMonitorAgent:
    """Background agent that runs continuously to monitor email replies."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.monitoring_active = False
        self.logs: List[MonitoringLog] = []
        self.log_file = Path("logs/background_monitor.log")
        
        # Set up logging
        self._setup_logging()
        
        # Set up email monitoring
        self.email_monitor.set_reply_callback(self._handle_email_reply)
    
    async def start_background_monitoring(self):
        """Start the background monitoring process."""
        self.monitoring_active = True
        
        while self.monitoring_active:
            # Check for emails
            # Process replies
            # Log everything
            await asyncio.sleep(1)
```

### **Log Management**
```python
def log_entry(self, level: str, message: str, details: Optional[Dict] = None):
    """Add a log entry."""
    log_entry = MonitoringLog(
        timestamp=datetime.now(),
        level=level,
        message=message,
        details=details
    )
    self.logs.append(log_entry)
    
    # Keep only last 1000 logs in memory
    if len(self.logs) > 1000:
        self.logs = self.logs[-1000:]
    
    # Log to file
    self.logger.info(message)
```

### **File Logging**
```python
def _setup_logging(self):
    """Set up logging configuration."""
    logging.basicConfig(
        level=logging.INFO,
        format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
        handlers=[
            logging.FileHandler(self.log_file),  # File logging
            logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)    # Console output
        ]
    )
```
