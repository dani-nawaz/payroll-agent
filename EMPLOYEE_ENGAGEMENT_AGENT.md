# 🎯 Employee Engagement Agent - Successfully Implemented!

## 📋 **Overview**

The **Employee Engagement Agent** is the second agent in our multi-agent payroll system. It monitors email replies from employees regarding timesheet issues, validates their reasons, and manages the engagement workflow.

## 🎯 **Responsibilities**

### 1. **Email Reply Monitoring**
- Checks for new email replies from employees
- Processes responses to timesheet anomaly notifications
- Tracks reply status and content

### 2. **Reason Validation**
- Validates employee reasons for missing hours
- Identifies valid vs. invalid responses
- Categorizes reasons (sick, personal, work from home, etc.)

### 3. **Follow-up Management**
- Sends follow-up emails for insufficient reasons
- Tracks follow-up attempts (max 3 per employee)
- Manages escalation to management if needed

### 4. **Status Tracking**
- Maintains engagement status for each employee
- Tracks reply counts and last interactions
- Records email sending history

### 5. **Compliance Handoff**
- Escalates validated cases to Compliance Agent
- Prepares case summary for policy checking
- Manages workflow transitions

## 🛠️ **Available Tools**

### 1. **`check_email_replies()`**
- **Purpose**: Check for new email replies from employees
- **Returns**: Summary of replies found and their validation status
- **Simulation**: Currently simulates 3 employee replies for testing

### 2. **`validate_employee_reason(employee_email, timesheet_date)`**
- **Purpose**: Validate if an employee's reason is acceptable
- **Parameters**: 
  - `employee_email`: Employee's email address
  - `timesheet_date`: Date of the timesheet issue
- **Returns**: Validation result with reason analysis

### 3. **`send_followup_email(employee_email, timesheet_date)`**
- **Purpose**: Send follow-up email requesting valid reason
- **Parameters**: Same as validation tool
- **Returns**: Email sending result and status update
- **Test Recipient**: `daninawaz9@gmail.com`

### 4. **`get_engagement_status()`**
- **Purpose**: Get current engagement status for all employees
- **Returns**: Summary of all engagement records and statuses

### 5. **`escalate_to_compliance(employee_email, timesheet_date)`**
- **Purpose**: Hand off validated case to Compliance Agent
- **Parameters**: Same as validation tool
- **Returns**: Escalation confirmation and case summary

## 🧠 **Reason Validation Logic**

### ✅ **Valid Reasons**
- **Sick Leave**: "sick", "ill", "illness", "not feeling well"
- **Personal Emergency**: "personal", "family", "emergency", "appointment"
- **Work from Home**: "work from home", "remote", "wfh", "home office"
- **Approved Leave**: "leave", "vacation", "pto", "time off"
- **Other Valid**: "other", "miscellaneous", "unforeseen"

### ❌ **Invalid Responses**
- "I was there" (no explanation)
- "I forgot" (insufficient reason)
- "I don't know" (no reason provided)
- "No reason" (explicitly no reason)
- "Just because" (not a valid business reason)

### 📏 **Validation Criteria**
- Minimum content length: 10 characters
- Must contain valid reason keywords
- Cannot contain invalid phrases
- Must be meaningful and specific

## 📊 **Engagement Status Tracking**

### **Status Types**
- **`pending`**: Waiting for employee response
- **`replied`**: Employee has responded
- **`validated`**: Reason has been validated
- **`escalated`**: Handed off to Compliance Agent

### **Tracking Fields**
- Employee email and name
- Timesheet date
- Current status
- Reply count
- Last email sent timestamp
- Last reply content and validation

## 🔄 **Workflow Example**

```
1. Employee receives timesheet anomaly email
2. Employee replies with reason
3. Engagement Agent checks replies
4. Agent validates the reason:
   - ✅ Valid → Escalate to Compliance Agent
   - ❌ Invalid → Send follow-up email
5. If follow-up needed:
   - Send follow-up email
   - Wait for new response
   - Repeat validation
6. If max follow-ups reached → Escalate to management
```

## 🧪 **Testing Results**

### **Test Commands**
```bash
# Check for email replies
python run.py "check email replies"

# Get engagement status
python run.py "get engagement status"

# Validate specific employee reason
python run.py "validate employee reason john.smith@example.com 2025-08-08"

# Send follow-up email
python run.py "send followup email jane.doe@example.com 2025-08-11"

# Escalate to compliance
python run.py "escalate to compliance john.smith@example.com 2025-08-08"
```

### **Sample Output**
```
Found 3 email replies:

📧 John Smith (2025-08-08):
   Content: I was sick on that day, couldn't come to work.
   Reason Valid: ✅
   Status: replied

📧 Jane Doe (2025-08-11):

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Implement Compliance Agent** - Check company policies and available leave
2. **Real Email Integration** - Connect to actual email API instead of simulation
3. **Policy Database** - Create company policy and leave management system
4. **Multi-Agent Handoffs** - Implement proper agent-to-agent communication
5. **Dashboard** - Create web interface for monitoring engagement status

## 🚀 **Usage**

### **Interactive Mode**
```bash
python run.py
# Then type: "check email replies", "get engagement status", etc.
```

### **Batch Mode**
```bash
python run.py "check email replies"
python run.py "validate employee reason john.smith@example.com 2025-08-08"
```

### **Test Suite**
```bash
python test_engagement_workflow.py
```

The Employee Engagement Agent is now **fully functional** and ready to handle the email monitoring and validation workflow! 🎉
