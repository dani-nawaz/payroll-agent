# 🔄 Continuous Background Email Monitoring

## 🎯 **Feature Overview**

The system now supports **continuous background email monitoring** that allows you to:
- Start monitoring for email replies
- Continue working on other tasks while monitoring runs in background
- Get real-time notifications when new replies arrive
- Have AI automatically analyze and process replies

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **1. Start Continuous Monitoring**
```bash
# When you say "check replies" or similar
python run.py
# Then type: "check replies"
```

**What happens:**
- ✅ Starts background monitoring process
- ✅ Checks for new emails every 60 seconds
- ✅ Runs continuously without blocking your work
- ✅ Provides notifications for new replies
- ✅ AI automatically analyzes reasons

### **2. Background Processing**
```
Your Work ←→ System Monitoring
    ↓              ↓
Continue tasks   Check emails
Analyze data     Process replies  
Send emails      Update status
Run reports      Send notifications
```

### **3. Real-time Notifications**
When new email replies are found:
```
🔔 [NOTIFICATION] Found 2 new email reply(ies)!
   📧 From: John Smith (john.smith@example.com)
   📅 Date: 2025-08-08
   📝 Subject: Re: Timesheet Issue - 2025-08-08
   💬 Content: I was sick on that day, couldn't come to work...
   --------------------------------------------------
   📧 From: Jane Doe (jane.doe@example.com)
   📅 Date: 2025-08-11
   📝 Subject: Re: Missing Hours - 2025-08-11
   💬 Content: I was there but forgot to log my hours...
   --------------------------------------------------
```

## 🛠️ **Available Commands**

### **Start Monitoring**
```bash
"check replies"           # Start continuous monitoring
"start email monitoring"  # Alternative command
```

### **Check Status**
```bash
"get monitoring status"   # Check if monitoring is active
```

### **Stop Monitoring**
```bash
"stop email monitoring"   # Stop background monitoring
```

## 📊 **Monitoring Status**

When monitoring is active, you'll see:
```
📧 Email monitoring is already active in background:

• Active: ✅ Yes
• Last Check: 2025-01-27T10:30:15
• Processed Messages: 3
• Check Interval: 60 seconds

💡 The system is continuously monitoring for replies while you work on other tasks.
```

## 🎯 **Key Benefits**

### **✅ Non-Blocking Operation**
- Start monitoring and continue with other work
- No need to wait or manually check for replies
- System works automatically in background

### **✅ Real-time Processing**
- AI analyzes replies immediately when found
- Automatic reason validation and categorization
- Instant status updates and notifications

### **✅ Intelligent Automation**
- AI determines if reasons are valid
- Automatic follow-up email sending if needed
- Escalation to compliance agent when appropriate

### **✅ Full Control**
- Start monitoring anytime
- Stop monitoring when not needed
- Check status at any time
- Configure monitoring intervals

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Background Task Management**
```python
# Start monitoring in background
monitoring_task = asyncio.create_task(email_monitor.start_monitoring())

# Continue with other work
await process_other_tasks()
```

### **Continuous Loop**
```python
while self.monitoring_active:
    try:
        replies = await self.check_for_replies()
        if replies:
            # Process and notify
            await self.process_replies(replies)
        await asyncio.sleep(60)  # Check every 60 seconds
    except Exception as e:
        # Continue monitoring even if errors occur
        await asyncio.sleep(60)
```

### **User Notifications**
```python
if replies:
    print(f"\n🔔 [NOTIFICATION] Found {len(replies)} new email reply(ies)!")
    for reply in replies:
        print(f"   📧 From: {reply.from_name} ({reply.from_email})")
        print(f"   📅 Date: {reply.timesheet_date}")
        print(f"   📝 Subject: {reply.subject[:50]}...")
        print(f"   💬 Content: {reply.content[:100]}...")
```

## 🎮 **Usage Examples**

### **Scenario 1: Start Monitoring and Work**
```bash
python run.py
> check replies
✅ Started continuous email monitoring in background. You can now do other things while the system monitors for replies automatically.

> analyze timesheets
[Your timesheet analysis continues while monitoring runs in background]

> send email to all employees with pending
[Email sending continues while monitoring runs in background]
```

### **Scenario 2: Check Status While Working**
```bash
> get monitoring status
📧 Email monitoring is already active in background:
• Active: ✅ Yes
• Last Check: 2025-01-27T10:30:15
• Processed Messages: 3
• Check Interval: 60 seconds

💡 The system is continuously monitoring for replies while you work on other tasks.
```

### **Scenario 3: Stop Monitoring**
```bash
> stop email monitoring
✅ Email monitoring stopped successfully.
```
